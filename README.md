# Social_media_project

  Reason for Creation:
  - <b>Utilizing diverse technology stacks:</b> By integrating various technologies such as app development, backend, and databases, the process of completing a project allows for the enhancement of skills in using and integrating diverse technology stacks.
  - <b>Implementing comment and social features:</b> I created this to experience the integration work between backend and frontend by implementing social features such as comments, likes, and shares that promote user interaction.
  - <b>Practicing security and permission management:</b> I created this project, similar to Instagram, to gain an understanding of user authentication, permission granting, and data security aspects, as part of practicing security and authorization management.
